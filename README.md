# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This program was designed to show how much money a person would earn over five years in a savings account based on three user inputs--an initial deposit,  monthly deposits, and the interest rate. The user can enter different amounts for each of those particulars, and then see the differences.

# What did you do particularly well?

The menu set up was simple and works well.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

Perhaps writing the menu as a function instead of putting it in main would be better. I couldn't figure out how to make a menu function that would loop after the user enters information once. The program just ended if I tried using a function, so I moved it to main. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I had some trouble with calculating my year-end balance properly using for loops. It took several tries and I spent time talking to other students and using the tutoring service. I got it to work in the end.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Writing good, functional for loops for complex math equations is useful and important, and I will be able to use those skills on future projects. I will also be able to troubleshoot better after having to do so on this project.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I used headers and created different functions to serve the purpose of each of the inputs. In main there is only code for the menu and calling the functions.
